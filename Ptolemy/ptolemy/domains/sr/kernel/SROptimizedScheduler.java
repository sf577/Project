/**
 * A scheduler the Synchronous Reactive (SR) domain. This scheduler returns a
 * static schedule for the graph. The schedule guarantees that the values will
 * converge to a fixed-point.
 * <p>
 * The recursive scheduling algorithm is due to Stephen Edwards, and is
 * described in his Ph.D. thesis. First, a dependency graph is constructed, and
 * the strongly connected components (SCC) are determined. A schedule for each
 * SCC is obtained by separating the sub-graph into a head and a tail, and then
 * recursively applying this algorithm to both the head and the tail. The
 * schedule for the SCC is (<i>TH</i>)<super><i>n</i></super><i>T</i> where
 * <i>H</i> and <i>T</i> are the schedules of the head and tail, respectively,
 * and <i>n</i> is the number of nodes in the head and represents the number of
 * repetitions of the parenthesized expression. Finally, the schedules of the
 * top-level SCCs are concatenated in topological order to obtain the schedule
 * for the entire graph.
