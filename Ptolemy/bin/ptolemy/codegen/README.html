<h1>Code Generation</h1>
This code generator is patterned after the Ptolemy Classic 
code generator where actors have template files consisting
of code blocks.  The code blocks are stitched together to create
the resulting file.

<h2><a name="Limitations">Limitations</a></h2>
This is a highly preliminary code generator facility, with many 
limitations.  It is best viewed as a concept demonstration.

<ul>
<li> Only SDF, FSM and HDF domains are supported
<li> Only IntToken, DoubleToken, StringToken and ArrayToken are supported.
Other tokens are not supported at this time.
<li> A limited number of actors have supporting helper code.
The easiest way to build models that only the actors that have
code generation support is to run
<pre>
$PTII/bin/vergil -codegen
</pre>

</ul>

<dl>
<dt> Models that use a plotter fail to compile.
<dd> Models that use the plotter use the Java Native Interface (JNI)
to invoke the plotter from within the C process. This is done
so that the plotter is interactive while the model is running
as opposed to plotting the data after the model completes.
The JNI facility requires that a Java Development Kit (JDK)
be installed instead of a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
The Ptolemy II Windows installer includes a JRE which is optionally
installed.  If the Windows installer is installed with the bunded
JRE, then models that use the plotter will probably fail to compile
with message like:
<pre>
make: *** [Ramp] Error 1
</pre>

<dt> Models that use the plotter require setup
<dd> To properly run a model that has a plotter, you must have jvm.dll
in your path.
If you do not, then when you run the executable, it will immediately exit
with no message!
For example, place <pre>C:\Progra~1\Java\jdk1.5.0_11\jre\bin\client</pre>
in your path.  If you are running Vergil from the command line as 
$PTII/bin/ptinvoke, then this has been handled for you.
If you are running via Eclipse, then you must update your path by hand.

<dt> When in Windows, clicking on a .exe produced by the 
code generator fails to start up.  The message is:
 <br>  The procedure entry point _impure_ptr could not be located in
  the dynamic link library cygwin1.dll
<dd> The solution is to add <CODE>C:\cygwin\bin</CODE> to the
Windows path by doing:
<CODE>Start Menu </CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Settings</CODE> -&gt;
<CODE>Control Panels</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>System</CODE> -&gt;
<CODE>Advanced</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Environment Variables</CODE>
and adding <CODE>C:\cygwin\bin</CODE> to the path.
 <br>To get rid of the console, compile with the exe with -mwindows:
<pre>
make -f <I>Model</I>.mk CC_FLAGS=-mwindows
</pre>

<dt> Generating code results in <code>IOException: java.io.IOException: CreateProcess: make -f <i>Model</i>.mk error=2</code>
<dl> This will happen if <code>make</code> is not in your path.
Under Windows, you may need to install Cygwin, see the
<a
href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptIIlatest/cygwin.htm">Ptolemy
II Cygwin installer</a>.  Under Windows, if Cygwin is installed, then
be sure that <code>C:\cygwin\bin</code> is in your Windows path.
To edit your path, do <CODE>Start Menu </CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Settings</CODE> -&gt;
<CODE>Control Panels</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>System</CODE> -&gt;
<CODE>Advanced</CODE> -&gt; <CODE>Environment Variables</CODE>.
